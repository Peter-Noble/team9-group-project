Install VirtualBox and Vagrant

Initialise Vagrant: vagrant init

Create the VM: vagrant up (or “vagrant up --provider virtualbox” if other hypervisors are present)

Add vagrant-vbguest (which makes sure the virtualbox “guest additions” are installed and up to date every time the VM is started up)

Add vagrant-cachier (which puts the package cache into a folder on the host PC, so that if you destroy and rebuild the VM, it won’t have to download updates from the Internet again - much quicker).

Add this to Vagrantfile, after the line: config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
  if Vagrant.has_plugin?("vagrant-cachier")
    # Configure cached packages to be shared between instances of the same base box.
    # More info on http://fgrehm.viewdocs.io/vagrant-cachier/usage
    config.cache.scope = :box

    # For more information please check http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/basic_usage.html
  end


See: http://fgrehm.viewdocs.io/vagrant-cachier/usage/

Add this to the end of Vagrantfile (before the last “end”):
  config.vm.provision "shell", path: "bootstrap.sh"

Create the bootstrap.sh file:
#!/bin/sh

apt-get update
apt-get install npm nodejs-legacy -y
npm install -g mean-cli

vagrant up

vagrant halt - shuts down the VM
vagrant reload - shuts down the VM, then starts it again (e.g. if Vagrantfile has been changed)
vagrant provision - redo the provisioning steps
